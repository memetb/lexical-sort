# Lexical Sort Generator

A python program to create educational content for an 8 year old. We are training the 8 year old's ability to sort lexicographically.

There are two distinct skills that need to be drilled and emphasized:
1. alphabetical sort order recall (i.e. knowing that p comes after o)
2. the algorithm of sorting (first comparing first letters, then second letters and so on)

The program will generate a list of word pairs and triplets and n-tuples for a child to compare and sort. (e.g. generate(3) => [(word1, word2, word3), ...]).

We want to be able to give progressive difficulties for the child to progress through while isolating the educational focus area. Some words will focus on point 1, where the skill gradient will be around the L1 distances between the words (large for easy, close and clustered for harder), whereas some words will focus on point 2 (e.g. foscle, follie, foal, feral).

Generate two functions, one for each goal, define their interfaces (each should have a difficulty parameter, and a count parameter). Create a third overarching function which creates a list of tuples, each tuple generated by either one of the generator functions. The overarching function should have kwargs that specify the settings to use to generate the lists (e.g. word lengths, tuple sizes, probability of #1 or #2 etc)
